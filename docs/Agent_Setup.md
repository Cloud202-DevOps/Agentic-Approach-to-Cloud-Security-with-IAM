# Agent Configuration and Setup

This document provides a comprehensive guide to setting up the AWS Bedrock Agent for IAM automation, configuring necessary permissions, defining action groups, and linking knowledge bases to enhance security recommendations.

## Setting Up AWS Bedrock Agent for IAM Automation

1. **Create the AWS Bedrock Agent**:  
   - Follow step-by-step instructions to deploy an AWS Bedrock Agent within your AWS environment.
   - This setup requires defining the agent's scope and purpose specifically for IAM automation tasks.

2. **Configure Agent Roles with IAM Permissions**:  
   - Assign the necessary IAM permissions to allow the agent to manage IAM tasks securely.
   - Ensure least privilege by limiting permissions to only those required for IAM actions.

## Defining Action Groups

Action groups categorize the types of tasks the agent will perform. Below are some example action groups:

- **CreateUser**:  
  - Defines the steps for automating user creation, with permissions limited to necessary actions.
  
- **EnforceMFA**:  
  - Configures the enforcement of multi-factor authentication for specified users.
  
- **AssignPermissions**:  
  - Manages the assignment of predefined permissions to users or roles.
  
- **MonitorPolicyCompliance**:  
  - Tracks policy adherence and reports deviations or potential security risks.

Each action group includes configuration options to tailor the agentâ€™s behavior. Below is a JSON configuration example for defining these groups:

```json
{
  "actionGroups": {
    "CreateUser": {
      "description": "Automate user creation with required IAM permissions.",
      "permissions": ["iam:CreateUser", "iam:AttachUserPolicy"]
    },
    "EnforceMFA": {
      "description": "Enforce multi-factor authentication for specified users.",
      "permissions": ["iam:EnableMFADevice", "iam:ListMFADevices"]
    },
    "AssignPermissions": {
      "description": "Assign permissions to users based on role.",
      "permissions": ["iam:AttachUserPolicy", "iam:DetachUserPolicy"]
    },
    "MonitorPolicyCompliance": {
      "description": "Monitor and report IAM policy compliance issues.",
      "permissions": ["cloudtrail:LookupEvents", "logs:PutLogEvents"]
    }
  }
}
