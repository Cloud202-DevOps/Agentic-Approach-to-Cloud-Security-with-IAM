# Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues

1. **Unable to Create Users**  
   - **Solution**: Verify that the IAM permissions and Bedrock configurations allow for user creation. Ensure that the `CreateUser` action group has been configured correctly and that the agent has the required permissions.

2. **Agent Not Responding to Commands**  
   - **Solution**: Check the status and configuration of the Bedrock agent to ensure it is running and connected properly. Verify that any network or permission issues are resolved.

## Debugging Tips

- **CloudTrail Logs**  
  - Use **AWS CloudTrail** to monitor IAM actions initiated by the agent. Reviewing these logs can help identify permission issues or misconfigurations in the action groups.

- **Bedrock Console**  
  - Access the **Bedrock console** to view detailed traces of function calls made by the agent. This can assist in debugging by showing the sequence of actions and responses for each command.
